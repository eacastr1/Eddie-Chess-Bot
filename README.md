MyBot is a bot that I developed in Java around a pre-existing Chess package made by Stephen G Ware.
To run the bot in a tournament or play it against it directly, follow this path
Eddie-Chess-Bot\src\com\stephengware\java\games\chess\bot
You can run the Test.java file to start a tournament between other bots, you can comment out which bots you wish not to participate in the tournmanent, and vice versa.
I recommend not to run against Intermediate Bot, as it can be a long match.
You can also comment out Human if you wish to play yourself!

Have fun, and thank you!
